# OVERVIEW

A revision of React training plan which focuses on the latest version of React (v17.0.2). It will help trainees learn React fundamentals step by step following the instructions and hands-on practices.

## TIMELINE

* Main Concepts and Hooks: 2 weeks
    * At the end of this step, trainees should be able to join projects for hot training and doing React Components.
* Advanced Guides: 2 weeks

# PREREQUISITE

Supporters should make sure trainees got below prerequisites

* [ES6](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
* Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16.x
* Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v6.x 

# GETTING STARTED

## BUILD TOOL

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

# REACT HOOKS

Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

* [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
* [Hooks at a Glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
* [useState Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
* [useEffect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
* [useContext Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
* [useRef Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)
* [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
* [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

## PRACTICE

This practice will let you understand about simple flow in React:

* Using React hooks.
* Filter and editing list of products
  * Create mocking data: write a JSON file and import it into your JSX
  * User filters by column values
  * User edits/deletes product item

At the end of this step, trainees should be able to join projects for hot training and doing React Components.
