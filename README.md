# GETTING STARTED]

## BUILD TOOL

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## HELLO WORLD

If you have pnpm installed already, letâ€™s start your first project using pnpm and vite. You can either choose template as react, or react-ts if you want to init with TypeScript. From your terminal, run

```bash
  pnpm create vite my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Install and run on local

```bash
  cd my-react-app
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Try modifying your React component and see how it changes.

If you are using VS Code and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), make sure you installed extension [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

Start reading [Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) documentation.

# MAIN CONCEPTS

Step by step learning the main concepts. For any examples you found in the documentation, you can try it in your first React app created above.

While reading Main Concepts, you can also do hands-on practice at the same time.

## STORYBOOK

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing and documentation.

Init storybook into your first React app:

```bash
  # init storybook
  pnpx sb init -s
  # install dependencies
  pnpm install
  # run it
  pnpm storybook
```

Try to create a Storybook for your example components. [https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/simple-component/](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/simple-component/)

## PRACTICE

Apply what you have read to rewrite your previous HTML/CSS practice into React components.

* Apply Storybook into your practice.
